      <p class="info para">These graphs show the keywords extracted from the sentiment analysis. It plots them based on their relevance, and sentiment score. If you hover over a point you can see it's associated comment. It should be noted that depending on the genre, the sentiment is not always completely accurate. For example, a hip-hop or club song tends to have more profanity in the comments which is interpereted as negative sentiment, but really should be positive.

      <p class="info para">This graph shows the ratio of how many times a song has been played versus how many followers the user/artist who posted the song has. It is a good metric to determine the popularity of a song. A higher ratio is indicative of a song that may have been shared and listened to across platforms other than SoundCloud, such as blogs and other websites.</p>

      <p class="info para">This graph shows the ratio of likes to comments. It is a good metric for determining engagement. For example, a high ratio could mean that people both liked and commented on a song, or that people didn't like the song, but commented (negatively) on it. The sentiment analysis of the song is meant to help determine which of these is true.</p>

      <p class="info para">This graph shows how many people engaged with the song by either liking or commenting on it relative to the number of followers the user/artist has. A low ratio means that it has a high level of engagement, however after an artist reaches upwards of 1 million followers, the engagement per song tends to drop off.</p>

      <p class="info para">This graph shows the number of comments posted over the length of the song. Most people post comments at the beginning or end of a song, however, with this metric, you can also infer "good" or "bad" parts of the song if there is a spike/drop in the number.</p>
